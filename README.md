# Chisel Crossbar

This package contains a generic implementation of a bi-directional crossbar
switch in the Chisel hardware description language. You can include it in
your own Chisel or Verilog projects.

To install, run "sbt publish-local" and then add the following dependency
line to your build.sbt file.

    "com.mao.howard" %% "chisel-crossbar" % "0.1-SNAPSHOT"

The file CrossbarSwitch.scala has some comments explaining how it should be
used.

## Example Usage

    // this creates a switch with a forward path of width 8
    // a backward path of width 16
    // 4 ports on the 'left'
    // and 8 ports on the 'bottom'
    val switch = Module(new CrossbarSwitch(8, 16, 4, 6)

    // this sets up the switch so that port 2 on the left
    // and port 4 on the bottom are connected to each other
    switch.io.fw_left(2) := UInt(22)
    switch.io.bw_bottom(4) := UInt(54)
    switch.io.select(4) := UInt(2)
